Hello Hi, how are you?Nice to meet you, what are you doing in this townN: Don’t know just woke up hereOh, maybe, you need to talk to the mayor, he knows what to with all the driftersHere to start a new life.Well then, go to the mayor to figure it out. Where can I buy a drinkRight there at the bartenderAny jobs in townA few, some transporters are near the gas station and the mayors alway looking for more minimum wage workers.Goodbye
